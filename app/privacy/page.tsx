            This independent information website collects personal information only through the
            VIP registration form. There is no phone number or email address published on the
            site. This policy explains what is collected, why, where it is stored, and how to ask
            for deletion.
          </p>
          <h2 className="pt-2 text-3xl text-brand-primary">What is collected and why</h2>
          <p>
            The form collects first name, last name, email, phone, and whether you are a licensed
            real estate agent. Hidden technical fields may also capture UTM parameters
            (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content) from the address bar, the
            page path where you submitted, a consent timestamp, and a CASL consent flag. That
            information is used to respond to the registration request and to send project updates
            about South Banks Towns (formerly Coastal Towns) and similar pre-construction
            opportunities, consistent with the consent language on the form.
          </p>
          <h2 className="pt-2 text-3xl text-brand-primary">Where data is stored</h2>
          <p>
            Lead records are stored with a third-party processor, Supabase, in a dedicated leads
            table. The processor is used to hold the registration record and to support sending
            project updates. Access is limited to operating the registration list. This site does
            not sell registration lists.
          </p>
          <h2 className="pt-2 text-3xl text-brand-primary">How to request deletion</h2>
          <p>
            To request access, correction, or deletion of a registration record, submit the same{" "}
            <Link href="/register" className="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-brand-accent">
              VIP registration form
            </Link>{" "}
            and state the privacy or deletion request in place of a normal inquiry — for example
            in the name fields together with a clear note of the request, using the email address
            originally registered. That form is the sole contact mechanism on this site, including
            for privacy requests, because no phone number or email address is published.
          </p>
          <h2 className="pt-2 text-3xl text-brand-primary">Cookies and analytics</h2>
          <p>
            This site may load Google Analytics 4, Google Tag Manager, and the Meta (Facebook)
            Pixel when those measurement IDs are configured. Those tools set cookies or similar
            identifiers to measure visits, registration starts, and completed registrations. They
            are not required to read the public pages. Browser controls can block analytics
            cookies; doing so does not remove a lead already stored after a form submission.
          </p>
          <h2 className="pt-2 text-3xl text-brand-primary">PIPEDA</h2>
          <p>
            Personal information is handled in a manner intended to comply with Canada&apos;s
            Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA): collection is
            limited to what the form needs, used for the stated registration purpose, stored with
            a processor under that purpose, and available for deletion through the process above.
            Electronic marketing messages are sent only with the CASL consent collected on the
            form, which is unchecked by default.
          </p>
          <h2 className="pt-2 text-3xl text-brand-primary">Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            Pages are built to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA as a practical standard consistent with
            Ontario&apos;s Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) expectations
            for public-facing websites. If a page is difficult to use, send that note through the
            registration form so it can be reviewed.
